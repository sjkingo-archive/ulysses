(mostly) in descending order of urgency:

- DESIGN
- Load kernel into higher half (0xC0000000)
- Protected mode!
- Memory paging (http://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Paging) / VM
- PQ implementation (doubly LL)
- Process table (actually add process memory maps)
- Scheduler (round-robin)
- shutdown via APCI
- memory manager (first fit)
- GC?
